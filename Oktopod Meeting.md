We can use more than one account in Outlook. We use multiple accounts at a time. In the calendar section, you can see meetings scheduled or your schedule. You can set your calendar as per day, Weekly, or monthly view. The desktop version of outlook is easy to use because you can use it when you do not have internet but on the web, version internet is required to see emails or any updates.  
## List of Contacts 
In this section, you can see your contacts which are official contacts or you add other contacts by clicking new contacts. All of your contacts will be stored in it.
In addition to the official contacts, the user can also add other contacts manually by clicking on a button or link labeled "new contacts." When the user adds a new contact, it will be saved in the same section along with the official contacts. Overall, this section serves as a centralized location for all of the user's contacts. They can view and manage their contacts from this section, such as editing contact information, deleting contacts, or grouping contacts into categories.

## Difference between Reply and Replay All/Forward
"Reply," "Reply All," and "Forward" are common email functions that allow you to respond to an email in different ways. Here's a breakdown of the differences between these three functions:
- When you click "Reply," you are sending a response only to the sender of the email. This function is useful when you only need to respond to the sender and don't want to include other recipients in the conversation.
- Clicking "Reply All" sends a response to the sender of the email as well as all other recipients who were included in the original email. This function is useful when you need to respond to everyone involved in the conversation, and your response is relevant to all parties.
- "Forward" allows you to send the entire email to a new recipient, who was not included in the original email. This function is useful when you need to share the content of the email with someone who was not included in the original conversation. When you forward same email then you can delete the above forward details or make edits or some other changes in it
It's important to use these functions appropriately to avoid confusion and unnecessary email clutter. For example, if you only need to respond to the sender, using "Reply All" could result in unnecessary emails for others. Similarly, forwarding an email without considering the content or the context could be seen as inappropriate or unprofessional.
## Folders
You can see a different folder inside Outlook. If you face trouble finding an email for any specific person then you create a folder and save an email inside it for that person. Right-click on "Create New > Name that Folder> Press Enter > Folder Created. 
When you pen your outlook things to notice that it should be "Connected to:" Saw on the bottom toolbar. Because someone sends you an email or you do not receive it because you are not connected. Make sure it is always connected and folders are up to date.  
## Favourite section
If you are using Microsoft Outlook for email and have created folders to organize your emails, you may want to mark certain folders as favorites for quick access. To do this, you can right-click on the folder you want to mark as a favorite and select "Add to Favorites" from the contextual menu. Once you add a folder to your favorites in Outlook, it will appear in the "Favorites" section of the navigation pane on the left side of the Outlook window. This makes it easy to access your frequently used folders without having to navigate through the entire folder structure every time. You can also remove a folder from your favorites by right-clicking on it in the "Favorites" section and selecting "Remove from Favorites" from the contextual menu. This will remove the folder from the "Favorites" section but it will still be accessible in its original location within the folder structure.
You can hide folders inside favourite section by ussing Arrow inside it. 
## Archive Section
The Archive section in Microsoft Outlook is a feature that allows you to move older emails, calendar items, and other items from your primary mailbox to a separate archive mailbox. This helps you to manage the size of your mailbox, while still allowing you to access and search for these items if needed. The Archive section is typically located in the navigation pane on the left side of the Outlook window, below the "Inbox" and "Sent Items" sections. If you don't see the Archive section, you may need to enable it by going to the "File" tab in Outlook, selecting "Options," and then selecting "Advanced."
