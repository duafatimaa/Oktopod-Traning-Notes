# Overview:
"Out of Office" (OOF) is a feature in Microsoft Outlook that allows you to automatically send a reply to incoming emails when you are away from work, on vacation, or simply unavailable.  This feature is designed to let people know that the user is out of the office and when they will be back. The Out of Office message can be customized to include information about the user's availability and contact information for other colleagues who can help in their absence. This feature helps keep communication lines open while the user is away and can be used to manage expectations of availability during extended absences.
To set up an OOF message in Outlook, follow these steps:
- Open Outlook and click on the "File" tab.Click on "Automatic Replies" (or "Out of Office" if you're using an older version of Outlook).
- In the "Automatic Replies" window, click on the "Send automatic replies" checkbox.
- Select the start and end dates for your OOF message.
- Type your message in the "Inside My Organization" tab. This is the message that will be sent to people inside your company or organization.
- If you want to send a different message to people outside your organization, select the "Outside My Organization" tab and type your message there.
- Click "OK" to save your changes and turn on the OOF message.
# In Meeting: 
On outlook click on the "New Event" then you can see "E-mail Message, Appoinments". You can send email or fix appoinment. The "E-mail Message" section and the "Appointments" section are two important components of Microsoft Outlook that help you manage your communication and schedule in one centralized location.
## E-mail Message Section:
The "E-mail Message" section is where you can compose, send, receive, and manage email messages. From this section, you can create a new email message, reply to or forward an existing message, organize your messages into folders, and set up rules to automatically sort and manage your incoming mail. You can also manage your contacts, create and manage email signatures, and set up and manage your email accounts.
## Appointments Section: 
The "Appointments" section is where you can schedule, manage, and track your appointments, meetings, and events. From this section, you can create a new appointment, schedule a meeting with other people, invite attendees, and set reminders and alerts to remind you of upcoming appointments. You can also view your calendar in different formats, such as daily, weekly, or monthly views, and you can color-code appointments and events to make them easier to distinguish.
## Event Section:
The "Events" section in Microsoft Outlook is where you can create, manage, and track various types of events, such as birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and other important dates. It is similar to the "Appointments" section, but with some additional features. To create a new event in Outlook, go to the "Calendar" section and click on the "New Event" button. Here, you can enter details about the event, such as the title, location, start and end times, and any additional notes or comments. You can also invite attendees to the event, set reminders and alerts, and mark the event as recurring if it occurs on a regular basis.

In addition to creating events, you can also view and manage your events in the "Events" section. You can view your events in various formats, such as daily, weekly, or monthly views, and you can color-code your events to make them easier to distinguish. You can also edit or delete existing events, and set up email notifications to remind you of upcoming events. One useful feature of the "Events" section in Outlook is the ability to add national or religious holidays to your calendar. This can be especially helpful if you work with people in different countries or if you need to be aware of holidays that may affect your work schedule.
