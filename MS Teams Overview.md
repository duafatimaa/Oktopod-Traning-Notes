## Tasks by Planner Section:
The Tasks by Planner section in Microsoft Teams is where you can view and manage all your tasks and to-do lists in one place. This section integrates with Microsoft Planner, a project management tool that allows you to create and assign tasks to team members, set due dates, and track progress. In the Tasks by Planner section, you can view all your tasks across multiple plans, mark tasks as complete, and add new tasks. You can also filter and sort tasks by various criteria, such as due date, priority, and assignee.
## Difference between You Assigned Task Yourself or Manager Assigned Task to you:
When you assign a task to yourself, it means that you are taking ownership of the task and committing to completing it within the specified timeframe. You can create a task for yourself in the Tasks by Planner section, set the due date, and assign it to yourself. This allows you to manage your own workload and prioritize your tasks. After the task is complete you can mark it as complete.

On the other hand, when your manager assigns a task to you, it means that your manager is delegating a specific task to you that they believe you are capable of completing. Your manager will typically assign a due date and provide any necessary details or instructions for completing the task. This allows your manager to delegate tasks and manage the workload of their team more effectively. After the task is complete you cannot mark it as complete. It is done by your manager.

In summary, tasks that you assign to yourself are self-directed and based on your own priorities and workload, while tasks assigned to you by your manager are based on the needs of the team and the organization.
